# Next.js Toolkit — Sidebar Navigation

Reusable sidebar navigation component for hierarchical route structures.

## Language

**Route**:
A node in the navigation tree. Every Route has a `path` (string), `label` (string), and optional `children` (Route[]). Only leaf nodes (no children) trigger navigation.
_Avoid_: NavItem, MenuItem, Link

**Leaf node**:
A Route with no `children`. The only nodes that navigate the user when clicked.
_Avoid_: terminal, endpoint

**Full path**:
The concatenation of all ancestor `path` values from root to leaf, joined by `/`. This is the actual URL the user navigates to.
_Avoid_: resolvedPath, fullPath

**Level**:
Depth in the tree. Level 1 is top-level (always visible). Level 2 expands under a Level 1 click. Level 3 expands under a Level 2 click.
_Avoid_: depth, tier

**Collapsible section**:
A non-leaf Route whose children are hidden until clicked. Toggles open/closed with animation.
_Avoid_: expandable, toggleable
